Minesweeper-API

This is a restful api build with express and mongoose
This Api is deployed in Heroku and the database was created in mlab.com
Due to being a free version, no more deploys could be done to have the service running in Heroku, but it can still be run in a local environment which is already connected to the mongo database created in mlab.
You can import the postman_collection files that includes endpoints and examples for postman.
